# expense-tracker

Analyze and provide a segregation of the expenses for each customer based on the category of the expense.

Queue and File are the input sources through which we receive the input. 
Individual transactions (in JSON format) will be received through Queue. Transaction list (in JSON format) will be received via files (C:\personnal\workspace\Wells\filequeue\input).

Rest service is provided to retrieve the expense of each customer based on category.
